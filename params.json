I get a segmentation faul after extracting the preview image from exiv. Because of this I use the testing-packages from *stretch* repository\r\n- **OS X:** The gexiv2 library from *brew* isn't compiled with introspection. You have to compile it by yourself \r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nRemoteDslrApi - Python based API to interact with your DSLR [http://github.com/scheckmedia/RemoteDslrApi](http://github.com/scheckmedia/RemoteDslrApi) Copyright (C) 2015  Tobias Scheck\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
